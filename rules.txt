These are the rules that are followed for the clustering of blocks to form semantic paragraphs:


In order to cluster words (that are in the same line vertically but separated) in a single line:
Uses the "word2line" function in semantic_paragraphs.py
1. Take the first block
2. Check if any block is vertically close to it and separate from it
    - It does this by checking the y-midpoint of blocks and the distance between the two blocks
3. If the condition is satisfied, merge the two blocks, and move on to the next block
3. Repeat this for all blocks


In order to cluster blocks in a single semantic paragraph:
(Uses the line2para Function in semantic_paragraphs.py)

1. Take the first block
2. Iterate over all the next blocks and see if the block is close to the first block based on:
    - The y-midpoints of blocks
    - The distance between both
3. If the blocks are indeed close together (based on the distance), merge them, and consider this as the current block
4. If the blocks are not close enough check if they are part of the same paragraph:
    - Check if the previous block does not end with "." and the next block does not start with an upper case letter
5. If these two conditions are met, and the distance between the two blocks is not that large, merge these two, and move on to the next block
6. Repeat this for all blocks


TO-DO:
3. Function to merge any overlapping bounding boxes
4. Feature in main_function to output a JSON
5. Push code to github
6. Create a colab demo
